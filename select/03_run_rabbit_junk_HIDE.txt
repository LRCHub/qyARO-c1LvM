Kiss a cop
Goin' downtown
Need backup now, you know why?
I like talkin' 'bout weather
Car two, callin' car two
Got a fight
Dope an wild ice
Callin' cars
A jump to nowhere
Up, down take me downtown
Copy that I'm over and out
Another never
Another never
Another never
Hey you so how's your mother?
Come on, come on
Kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
Ain't no dancer
You're kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
You are done, sir
Party time at seven and vine
Everybody's setting up to breakdown
Hey you, dance a no dance
You do low-fi
You shootin' lowfare
Pretty girls who run about
Rabbit soft
A dime for some dare
Voodoo
A little bit of mars
Uptown
Callin' all cars
Kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
Ain't no dancer
You're kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
You are done, sir
Kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
Ain't no dancer
You're kickin' me
Are you dumb, sir?
Move, move
Are you done, sir?
You've makin' me
Mad enough, sir
Boom, boom
You are done, sir
